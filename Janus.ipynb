Without content in these designated files, there is no defined training logic or model implementation to execute, rendering the training task unfulfillable.\n",

        "*   The `Janus` repository's `my-llm-project` directory contains key components such as `requirements.txt` and a `trainer` directory.\n",
        "*   The `requirements.txt` file was found to be empty, indicating no explicit Python dependencies were listed for the project.\n",
        "*   The `trainer` directory contains `model.py`, `task.py`, and `curriculum.py`, which are typically associated with model definition, task execution, and curriculum learning, respectively.\n",
        "*   Crucially, all identified training-related files (`/content/Janus/my-llm-project/trainer/task.py`, `/content/Janus/my-llm-project/trainer/model.py`, and `/content/Janus/my-llm-project/trainer/curriculum.py`) were empty.\n",
